Respected Mam, 
I am a student at Masai School (student code fw16_175) currently in the (NEM201 async) course.

First of all, I was from that time in Masai when I requested for the JAVA course but I didn't get it. (IN UNIT 3).  

When I did not get it I also messaged our EC (at that time Manas sir was our EC) in slack to inform him that, I have studied B.Tech in Computer Science. I have studied JAVA and DBMS(MySQL) in our college and also learned some JDBC. If I will take Java Course I can do much better than the MERN stack.

When I did not get the course, I felt very bad. But somehow I continue the MERN stack. Earlier the course curriculum was up to the 5th Unit and 1 Unit was there for Revision. When I came to unit 5, one more unit has been introduced and I was promoted to unit 6. (at that time no option was there to take Option track and go directly into the revision batch )


In the meanwhile my and my family's Financial condition going to decrease day by day due to leaving my Job to Join Masai. Now the situation is that Not able to arrange our room rent also. Because I am the only earning member in my home. I did not even get the Glide amount due to some unavoidable reason from your(Masaiâ€™s) end.

As I said I will not able to concentrate on my study anymore because I have to earn for my family to survive, for that I might join a small type part-time JOB to continue my study.

If you give me an opportunity to learn JAVA. I may borrow some amount from my friends to survive at least for 2 to 3 months more. So that I can learn my favourite subject. Because I will be interested more to explore Java.
If possible put me in the JAVA batch. It's a humble request from my side.

Think from my perspective once sir and please give me one opportunity to learn Java. I am promising you that I will get a job within 2 to 3 months. I am ready to do hard work day and night.

Thank you sir once again.
